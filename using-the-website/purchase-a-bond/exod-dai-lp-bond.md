# EXOD-DAI LP Bond

1. Make sure you have EXOD-DAI LP tokens in your wallet. You need to go to SpookySwap and add liquidity for the [EXOD-DAI pool](https://spookyswap.finance/add/0x8D11eC38a3EB5E956B052f67Da8Bdc9bef8Abf3E/0x3b57f3FeAaF1e8254ec680275Ee6E7727C7413c7) to acquire them.
2. Head to the [EXOD-DAI LP Bond page of the EXODIA website](https://app.exodia.fi/bonds/exod_dai_lp). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.
3. Type in the amount of EXOD-DAI LP tokens you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of EXOD you can purchase.
4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the EXODIA contract to spend your EXOD-DAI SLP tokens. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
6. Click "Bond" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have purchased your first EXOD-DAI LP bond!
